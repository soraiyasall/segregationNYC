# segregation NYC

Although, NYC may be one of the most diverse cities, it is one of the most segregated cities in America. Segregation goes back generations and it still persists today - particularly within the American health system

More and more Americans are losing access to healthcare due to exorbitant costs due to the lack of a comprehensive healthcare insurance system. Although, New York City has a high percentage of minority groups, it is amongst these where uninsured rates are the highest.

Segregation is spatially distributed, particularly in healthcare centres. Despite the Affordable Care Act signed in 2010, there remains disparities on access to medical insurance, which impacts choice of health care centres. Geographic segregation is still deeply entrenched in society. Hospitals with a history of treating certain ethnic groups are still under-staffed and under-resourced.

We've mapped out hospital choice based on payment type, neighbourhood, and, cost. Studies have indicated, amongst adult hospital discharges, that ethnic minorities, uninsured people and Medicaid patients are vastly underrepresented in New York Cityâ€™s academic medical centres.
